# Sepsis Survival Minimal Clinical Records

This project focuses on predicting patient survival using machine learning techniques, with the goal of supporting faster and more informed clinical decision making.

## Project Overview

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition where the body's immune system overreacts to infection, potentially causing organ failure. Quick diagnosis is crucial since sepsis can progress rapidly, sometimes within an hour.

This project explores whether basic patient information Age, Sex, and number of prior Sepsis episodes can predict survival outcomes. We analyzed [a dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/827/sepsis+survival+minimal+clinical+records) of over 110,000 hospital admissions from Norway (2011-2012) using a Logistic Regression model.

**Key Findings:**
- Age emerged as the strongest predictor: older patients have lower survival probability (SHAP value: 0.86)
- The model achieved a ROC AUC of 0.59, showing limited predictive power
- Sex and Episode Number had minimal impact on predictions
- The dataset is highly imbalanced: 93% survivors vs. 7% non survivors

**Conclusion:** While Age is an important mortality risk indicator, these basic demographic factors alone are not sufficient for accurate predictions. Additional clinical features (vital signs, lab values, pre existing conditions) would be needed to improve the model's performance.

## Project Components

This project includes the following components:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data preprocessing and preparation
3. Training classification models to predict patient survival
4. Model evaluation and explainability
5. Final conclusions and discussion

## Dependencies

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
-   [VS Code Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

## Usage

### Setup

> If you are using Mac or Windows, ensure Docker Desktop is running.

1.  Clone this GitHub repository.

### Running the analysis

1.  Using the command line on your computer to go to the project's root directory, then run the following command:

``` bash
docker compose up
```

2.  In the terminal output, find a URL which begins with `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=` Copy that URL and open it in your web browser.

3.  To execute the analysis, open `src/sepsis-prediction-report.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab then under the "Kernel" menu choose "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...".

### Clean up

1.  To stop the container and remove associated resources, press `Ctrl` + `C` in the terminal where the container is running, then enter `docker compose rm`

## **Developer notes**

- Docker ensures full reproducibility without needing to manually configure dependencies, so anyone can run the environment consistently across operating systems without
  dependency conflicts.

### **Developer dependencies**

-   `conda` (version 25.7.0 or higher)

-   `conda-lock` (version 3.0.4 or higher)

### **Adding a new dependency**

1.  Create a new branch and add the dependency to the `environment.yml` file.

2.  Run the following command to update the `conda-linux-64.lock` file:

    ``` bash
    `conda-lock -k explicit --file environment.yml -p linux-64`
    ```

3.  Build the Docker image locally to verify it builds successfully and runs as expected.

4.  Commit and push the updates to GitHub. A new Docker image tagged with the commit's SHA will automatically be built and pushed to Docker Hub.

5.  Update the `docker-compose.yml` file and ensure the tag of the new container image is generated in your branch.

6.  Submit a pull request to have these updates merged into the `main` branch.

## Environment Setup

To reproduce the environment, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sepsis_survival_venv
```

### Using the Conda Lock File

This repository also includes a conda-lock.yml file generated to ensure full reproducibility across platforms and installations. This file contains exact, fully resolved dependency versions.

To create the environment using the lock file:

Install conda-lock if you do not already have it:

```bash
pip install conda-lock
```

or via conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge conda-lock
```

Generate the environment from the lock file:

```bash
conda-lock install --name sepsis_survival_venv conda-lock.yml
```

This will create (or update) the environment with the exact versions pinned in the lock file.

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate sepsis_survival_venv
```
